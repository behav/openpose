Hi Rick,

Yes, singularity is a container system, similar to Docker. 
If you want to test out openpose container, you can pull it down using the following:
$ singularity pull shub://dp2ski/openpose_aci:rec
on aci-i, then use
$ singularity shell $name_of_image.simg
to have a shell within the image. openpose is installed within /openpose-master 

Normally what we would do from this point is figure out what commands you would want to be able to run, and create a module file, so you could run openpose without having to shell into the image every time. 

Once you and Ori have a chance to take a look at that, let me know if you think that will work, and I can go ahead and make the module file, and walk you through getting it set up. 

Best,
Drew
